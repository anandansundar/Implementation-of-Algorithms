1. Run SkipList.java for operations on the skip list,

There will be a menu in which we can perform desired operations.

Menu will be like : 

Enter the operation you would like to perform : 
1. Add
2. Remove
3. Get index
4. Floor
5. Ceil
6. Search
7. Get Size
8. Get First element in the skip list
9. Get last element in the skip list
10. Print skip list

We can perform any operation from 1 through 9. 
10th one is always the final operation.

2. Run TreeSetComp.java for comparisions between TreeSet and SkipList.

It turns out for find operation, skip list wins.
For Insert and Remove operations running time of TreeSet is marginally lower than Skip list.
