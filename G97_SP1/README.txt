a). Intersect - Union - Set Difference (Main program)

Run IUSDriver.java, it provides input to IntersectUnionSetDifference.java. It is intially made to run for 1 million inputs and the approximate time for doing all three operations is around 0.115400533 seconds.
The Intersect, Union and Set Difference operations all run in O(n) running time.

For small sets, just uncomment some sysout statements to get user clarity.

b). Perform add and subtract operations on integers.

Run BigIntegers.java and provide the following details,
1. Enter the Base in which the operation will be performed.
3. Enter the size of list 1. Enter the numbers. Enter the size for list 2. Enter the numbers.

c). Write the Merge sort algorithm that works on linked lists. 

Run SortableList.java. The program already contains a sample input. The output will be sorted. Modification has been made to SinglyLinkedList.java which this program uses, to calculate the length of the linked list.

d). Recursive algorithm using a created stack which simulates recursion. ( Followed the logic from geeksforgeeks.org).

Run IterativeQuickSort.java and provide the following details,
1. Enter the size of the array and enter the numbers. 

e). MultiUnzip function

Run LinkedListZipper.java. Just call the  multiUnzip(int) function with any number in the argument.

f). Reversing a Linked List. Run SinglyLinkedList.java 

Examine the output for Recursive and Non-Recursive list for reversing.
